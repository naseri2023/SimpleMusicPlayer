# SimpleMusicPlayer
This project is a simple web-based music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
 The music player allows users to play, pause, skip to the next or previous track, adjust playback speed, and seek forward or backward within a track. It features a clean, modern user interface with responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various screen sizes.

Key Features:

Play/Pause: Users can easily start or pause the playback of music.

Next/Previous: Allows navigation between tracks in a predefined playlist.

Speed Control: Users can increase the playback speed of the current track.

Seek Functionality: Buttons enable jumping forward or backward by 5 seconds within a track.

Responsive Design: The player adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project serves as a foundation for building more advanced music players and can be extended with additional features such as volume control, progress bars, and playlist management.
